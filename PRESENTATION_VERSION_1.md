**Time: 3 minutes | Target: Judges & General Audience**

---

## 🎯 Opening (30 seconds)

**"Hi everyone! I'm Forrest Pan, and I'm excited to present Love-Dial - a Chrome extension that transforms how we connect on LinkedIn using AI."**

**"Have you ever scrolled through LinkedIn profiles wondering: 'Would we click? What would they sound like? Is there a spark?'"**

**"Love-Dial answers these questions by adding AI-powered voice previews and romantic compatibility scores directly to LinkedIn profiles."**

---

## 💡 The Problem (30 seconds)

**"LinkedIn is great for professional networking, but it's missing the human element. We see text, photos, and job titles, but we don't hear their voice or understand if there's genuine compatibility beyond the resume."**

**"Traditional networking is transactional - we connect, send a message, and hope for the best. But what if we could preview the connection before we even reach out?"**

**"That's where Love-Dial comes in."**

## 🚀 The Solution (60 seconds)

**"Love-Dial adds a pink 'Call' button to every LinkedIn profile. When you click it, two things happen:"**

**"First, we use ElevenLabs AI to generate a personalized voice message from your perspective. It says: 'Hi, I'm Forrest Pan, AI Research Engineer. I noticed you're [Name]. You're a [Headline]. I see you're interested in [About]. I'd love to connect!'"**

**"Second, we use Anthropic's Claude AI to analyze the profile and generate a romantic compatibility score from 0-100, plus personalized insights about potential connection points."**

**"The voice uses Antoni's voice - warm, professional, and engaging. The score helps you understand if there's genuine compatibility beyond just professional interests."**
