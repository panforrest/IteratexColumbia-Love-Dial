# 🎤 Love-Dial: 3-Minute Presentation (Version 3: Story & Impact Focus)

**Time: 3 minutes | Target: General Audience & Story-Driven Judges**

---

## 🎯 Opening Story (40 seconds)

**"Imagine you're scrolling through LinkedIn, and you see a profile that catches your eye. Great headline, interesting experience, but... you're not sure. Would you click? What would they sound like? Is there something beyond the resume?"**

**"I'm Forrest Pan, and I built Love-Dial to answer these questions. It's a Chrome extension that adds AI-powered voice previews and compatibility scores to LinkedIn - making professional networking feel more human, more personal."**

**"Let me tell you the story of how it works."**

## 💭 The Human Problem (35 seconds)

**"LinkedIn is amazing for professional networking, but it's missing something: the human connection. We see text on a screen - names, titles, descriptions. But we don't hear their voice. We don't feel the personality. We don't know if there's genuine compatibility."**

**"Think about it: when you meet someone in person, you hear their voice, you feel their energy, you sense the connection. Love-Dial brings that experience to LinkedIn."**

## ✨ The Magic Moment (60 seconds)

**"Here's how it works - and it's magical:"**

**"You're browsing LinkedIn, and you see a profile. There's a pink 'Call' button right there. You click it."**

**"A modal opens, and you see two options: 'Generate Voice Preview' and 'Get Romantic Score.'"**

**"You click 'Generate Voice Preview.' In seconds, you hear a personalized message: 'Hi, I'm Forrest Pan, AI Research Engineer & Serial Hackathon Winner. I noticed you're Sarah Chen. You're a Product Designer at Google. I see you're passionate about UX and AI. Your experience in design caught my attention. I'd love to connect and learn more about what you're working on. Let's chat!'"**

**"That voice - warm, professional, engaging - was generated by ElevenLabs AI, personalized just for this profile. It's not generic. It's tailored."**

**"Then you click 'Get Romantic Score.' You see: 87/100. The insights say: 'Strong alignment in tech interests, complementary skills in AI and design, potential for meaningful collaboration.'"**

**"In 30 seconds, you've heard their voice and understood the compatibility. You're not just connecting - you're connecting with confidence."**
